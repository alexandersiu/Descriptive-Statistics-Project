# Descriptive-Statistics-Project
Descriptive Statistics project that describes the factors that affect rainfall on New York City bridges.

This project describes the relationship between the amount of rainfall with the different bridges in New York City using descriptive statistics.

The first question answered is if the group needed to install sensors on the bridges to estimate the overall traffic across all of the bridges, but only have enough to install on three of the four total bridges.
We needed to decided which bridge to not put a sensor on to get the best prediction of the overall traffic.

The second question is to predict the total number of bicyclists based on the next day's weather forecast (whether it being low/high temperature and the amount of preciptation).

The last question is to determine if the data is able to predict whether it is raining based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges.

These questions are answered in the report.pdf with the code provided.
